## Funnel Design Simulation (B2B SaaS | 4–6 Week Sales Cycle)

**Lead**: Filled contact form or replied to outbound message  
**MQL**: Matches ICP (Industry, Role, Need), engages with 2+ assets  
**SQL**: Accepted meeting/demo, expresses budget/timeline intent  
**Customer**: Signed contract and payment completed

### Funnel Stages & Owners

| Stage       | Criteria/Activity                             | Owner       |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Lead        | Inbound form / outbound response               | Marketing   |
| MQL         | ICP-fit + Engagement                          | Marketing   |
| SQL         | Meeting booked + Buying intent                | Sales       |
| Opportunity | Proposal shared, negotiation in progress      | Sales       |
| Customer    | Payment completed                             | CS / Sales  |

**Bonus Stage: Opportunity**  
Rationale: Captures mid-funnel intent for better pipeline forecasting.
